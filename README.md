# SimpleCipherTool

This project gives you a clean way to encrypt and decrypt text using a shift-based cipher.
You choose a word and a key value, and the program returns the transformed text immediately.
Features
Encrypt text using a custom key
Decrypt text with the same key
Keep uppercase and lowercase letters
Ignore characters that are not alphabetic
How It Works

You enter the word you want to process.
You choose a key number.
The program shifts each letter forward or backward inside the alphabet.
This helps you understand the basics of text encryption through simple steps.

How to Run
python cipher.py

Example
Input word: hello
Key: 3
Encrypted: khoor
Future Ideas
Add option to encrypt full sentences
Add random key generator
